# Creation of an html page and link to github

For the evaluation we had to create an html page with its css code

Then we had to link this work to a Github repository




To retrieve the project:

```bash
https://github.com/luislebarbey/Eval-mds.git 
```

# A few tips to use Git

## Create your first repository

```bash
cd root/your_projects_repository
```

```bash
mkdir name_of_your_project
```

## Link it to your GitHub IDs

```bash
git config --global user.name your_user_name
```

```bash
git config --global user.email your_user_mail
```

## Check the IDs

```bash
git config --list
```

## Initialize git

```bash
git init
```

## Create the ReadMe.md file

```bash
touch ReadMe.md
```

md means markdown

## Index the ReadMe.md file

```bash
git add ReadMe.md
```

## Stage the ReadMe.md file

```bash
git commit -m "Title_of_the_change"
```

## Link the repository to the URL

```bash
git  origin url_of_the_repo
```

## Send the project on the distant repository as master

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## if you modified a file your need to add, then commit and finaly push your work to GitHub

```bash
git add name_of_the_file
```

```bash
git commit -m "Title_of_the_modification"
```

```bash
git push
```
